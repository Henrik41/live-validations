Installation instructions
=========================

The plugin is adapter based. There are currently adapters for the following libraries:

* http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/ (LiveValidations::Adapters::JqueryValidations)
* http://livevalidation.com (LiveValidations::Adapters::LivevalidationDotCom)

In parentheses is the class name of the adapter. When you have decided which adapter you want to use, do this:

* Download the javascripts for the adapter you've chosen, and make sure to include them in your application layout.
* Run "ruby script/plugin install git://github.com/leethal/live-validations.git"
* Run "ruby script/generate live_validator" (skip this step if you're on 2.3)
* Add LiveValidations(the-class-name-of-the-adapter) in an initializer or at the bottom of environment.rb See the list above if you're unsure which class name you should use.
* Add :live_validations => true to the forms you want live validations on. Example: <% form_for(@post, :live_validations => true) %>
* There is no step 6!
